For coding i used the Visual Studio code 
I created a new text-Dokument File and rename it to a "index.html" 
I created anathor file and renamed it to "readme.md" 
To wrtite a cod I use to open the file with the Visual studio code 
Fistly I have to download the nodejs
After downloading the nodejs I have to run this cammand 
So I have to the command prompt and write the code " npm i -g create-react-app@1.5.2 " and after that run the command 
then we should istall tow extentions that make it easier to build react application in Visual Studio code 
So I have to open the extentions panel on the left of the Visual studio code and search for Simple react Snippets 
And the another extenstions is Prettier-Code formatter 
We used this extentions to reformate our code 
Than it is goog to enable formatting unsavedto do that we have to go to the settings 
I find that in file on the top and then -prferences -settings 
Now I can create the app on command prompt withwritting the code " create-react-app react-app
Now is to install node.js 
to code is: 
create-react-app test-app
cd test-app
npm start

the rest is written as comments in the html
